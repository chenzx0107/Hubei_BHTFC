# Hubei_BHTFC
This project includes 123 built heritage sites in West Hubei, integrating historical literature and geospatial analysis. It could be used to reveal a phased construction pattern (1963â€“1980) with concentrated layouts, followed by partial demolition post-1980.

# What does this project do
This database archives spatiotemporal evolution data of Third Front construction heritage (1963-1980) in Western Hubei, including:
- Geographic coordinates of 123 industrial heritage sites
- Historical phase classification (1963-1980 construction period / post-1980 demolition phase)
- Industry type distribution (30% automotive manufacturing, 12.5% aerospace, 9.2% special equipment, etc.)
